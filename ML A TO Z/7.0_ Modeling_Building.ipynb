    "# The ML Modeling Process Basics \n",
    "In this notebook, we will go through some of the basic techinques for modeling data. This is a companion workbook for the 365 Data Science course on ML Process. This notebook only foucses on implementation. Check out the course or the documentation for the in-depth explanations of each step\n",

    "### On the Data \n",
    "This dataset is a good representation of real world data that can have valuable impact when analyzed. We will be exploring the accuracy of different models for predicting if someone will purchase an auto insurance policy or not. We will first lightly explore the data, create our train, test / validation sets, then we will ceate a baseline model. To get the best results we will compare other algorithms to our basline and use various parameter tuning techniques to see which model produces the best results. At the end we will explore some ensemble models to see what produces the best results. \n",

    "The focus of this notebook is the modeling process. If you're interested in the specifics of differen machine learning algorithms, check out our other course specifically on that. "
